# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I believe that the greatest area of risk while completing this project is how one should handle different edge cases of errors.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- The first thing I noticed when I saw the mock assets was the svg logos in the card headers were small. So, that's the first one I would change. Secondly, putting a bit of rounded corners would help with a good user interaction - it draws their eyes away from the corners and onto the content itself. Lastly, I would ease a bit or balance on the use of box-shadow / drop-shadow. If one should use it, the best way (in my opinion) to aim is the Material Design one.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- The first feature that I thought of was users being able to click on the card issue and be able to see comments (updates) on the issue/pull request. The second feature would be users are able to log-in to the web app and they can see a widget/mini-dashboard where they'll be able to see all their repositories that have issues/pull requests.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- The design and build decisions I had were mainly fueled by me trying to learn new technologies. Such as Next.js, SWR, Vercel.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- Planning/rough drafting => 30 mins ~ 1 hourish
- Learning Frameworks (Vercel,Next.js,SWR) => 1 ~ 2 hours
- Coding => 4 ~ 6 hours
- Debugging and clean-up => 45 mins ~ 1.30 hourish

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- I should have overprepared on this project so I could have finished it earlier.

> Did you learn anything new?

- Yes, I learned Next.js / SWR / Vercel

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- I certainly believe so. I always give my best regardless of how small or how big the project is. It's fun to learn!

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- I wouldn't necessarly say "significant" but it would've been fun to have a project that invloves a bit of server-side programming (back-end) and some tinkering on databases.
